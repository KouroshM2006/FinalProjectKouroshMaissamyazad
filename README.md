# Course Management System By Kourosh Maissamyazad
The Course Management System (CMS) is designed for educational institutions to manage courses, students, teachers, and assignments. Administrators can create user accounts, teachers can manage courses and assignments, and students can enroll in courses, view assignments, and manage their schedules. The system maintains academic records and facilitates interactions between these user types.


log: 50% implementation
- Fully implemented both super classes
- decision to remove the uploadSchedule method from the Student class, becaue I don't think it would be necessary
- implemented the Course class and later I will add the courseComparator insider class to it
- fully implemented the createUser interface
