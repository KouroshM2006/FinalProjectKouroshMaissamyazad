# Course Management Sytem By Kourosh Maissamyazad
The Course Management System (CMS) is designed for educational institutions to manage courses, students, teachers, and assignments. Administrators can create user accounts, teachers can manage courses and assignments, and students can enroll in courses, view assignments, and manage their schedules. The system maintains academic records and facilitates interactions between these user types.
